#R Practice for Types of Cars
#Code by: Natasha Iyer
summary(mtcars)


efficient <- subset(mtcars, mpg>23)


#Use one of the commands you
learned in the demystifying.R to answer this question.
```{r}
x <- subset(mtcars, mpg>23)
y <- row.names(x)
length(y)



#shows cars where MPG greater than 30 and horsepower greater than 100
subset(mtcars, mpg > 30 & hp > 100)


#shows cars where MPG is less than 14 OR displacement is greater than 390
subset(mtcars, mpg < 14 | disp > 390)


#Note: You may be familiar with the || operator in Java. R uses one single & for the logical
#operator AND. It also uses one | for the logical operator OR.






#Prints the cars that have a 1/4 mile time (qsec) less than or equal to
16.90 seconds to the console.

subset(mtcars, qsec <= 16.90)


#Save the subset of cars that weigh under 2000 pounds (weight is measured in lb/1000) to a variable called lightCars. Print the numbers of cars and the subset to the console.

lightcars <- subset(mtcars, wt < 2)
xy <- row.names(lightcars)
xy
length(xy)


#Create new variable
mtcars$year <- 1974

#Drops a variable
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)


#Adds year variable
mtcars$year <- c(1973, 1974)



#Drop the year variable from the data set.

mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)


#ifelse() preview
mtcars$wt
cond <- mtcars$wt < 3
cond
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')

mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)
